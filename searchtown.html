			<br>
			<p>You head towards the town, following a dirt track leading in. <br><br> Entering, you find the area dotted in small huts and houses. Further in, small shops and stalls engulf you in scents and smoke, with vibrant colours all around.<br><br>You manage to find a repairman who knows a small amount about engine repairs. Leading him back to your ship, toolbox in hand, you tell him what happened to the ship, explaining the engine issues.<br><br> He begins repairing the engine, repurposing scrap metal brought along. The man is able to fix the engine, bringing it roaring back to life.<br><br></p>
